Download the java file "McCusker_Assignment1" and open it using a java compiler. From there use the run command
and the program will compile using the variables declared in the "public static void main(String[] args) //main method".
The compiler will print "YES" if it compiles with the white and black queens in the correct locations (corect being not
attacking each other) with an input value that works. It will print "NO" if the values do not work. For example, it will 
print the board, location of the queens, and "YES" if the values of n*m exceed the number of w or b queens. It will print 
"NO" if it runs into an error with the values given.
